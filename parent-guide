<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Are you getting a gift for your child but have no idea what kind of skateboard you should get? The good news is that it&rsquo;s not that complicated. All of our products pretty much fall into one of two categories: Longboards and Shortboards.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">What&rsquo;s the difference between a Longboard and a Shortboard you ask?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Shortboards such as <a title="Skateboard Completes" href="http://www.scuffz.com/skateboards-1/" target="_top">trickboards</a> are generally used for street skating. The nose and tail of the board are raised allowing skilled skaters to perform tricks such as kick flips and ollies. <a title="Cheap Longboards" href="http://www.scuffz.com/longboards/" target="_top">Longboards</a> are generally used for cruising long distances. They can be used to perform tricks as well but of a different style.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">We&rsquo;ll be asking you a few questions to determine which boards best fit your child&rsquo;s needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">If your child is between the ages of 5-10 we&rsquo;d recommend going with a <a title="Skateboard" href="http://www.scuffz.com/skateboards-1/" target="_top">trickbboard</a>. It&rsquo;s light enough for them to be able to maneuver it and its wide wheelbase provides the stability they need when first learning how to skate. In addition, trickboards are excellent for advanced skaters as well which means that this board will still be relevant as their skills improve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">We have a variety of trickboards but the most popular would be the <a href="http://www.scuffz.com/checkered-complete-skateboard/" target="_self">Punked Checker Skateboard Complete</a>. This new school skateboard comes with a mellow concave allowing for a more flat-footed skating style. The edges of the board are not so bowled compared to medium and steep concaves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">If so we&rsquo;d recommend choosing a longboard. The bigger board gives more stability and generally has a smaller learning curve to get started. The <a title="Kicktail Longboard Completes" href="http://www.scuffz.com/longboard-kicktail-completes/">kicktail</a> is a great choice for beginners do to the fact that they have more maneuverability at low speeds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">A popular choice is the <a href="http://www.scuffz.com/kicktail-tsunami-complete/" target="_self">Punked Tsunami Kicktail Longboard Complete</a>. In addition to having a kicktail, it also has a medium concave that will help with big tricks, pivots, slides, ollies, and much more. The longer wheelbase gives more stability for downhill speedboarding while also giving more footspace when cruising.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In this case we&rsquo;d recommend a <a title="Drop Through Longboards" href="http://www.scuffz.com/longboard-drop-through-complete/" target="_top">drop through</a> or <a title="Drop Down Longboards" href="http://www.scuffz.com/longboard-drop-down-completes/">drop down</a> longboard. Both these boards have a lower center of gravity making it more stable at faster speeds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">A popular drop down is the <a href="http://www.scuffz.com/drop-down-rasta-2-longboard-complete/" target="_self">Punked Rasta 2 Longboard Complete</a>.

<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">If so, we&rsquo;d highly recommend the <a title="Vinyl Plastic Cruisers" href="http://www.scuffz.com/vinyl-cruisers/" target="_top">vinyl cruisers</a>. They were very popular back in the 70&rsquo;s and now they&rsquo;ve been brought back! These plastic-injection molded decks are the smallest boards that we carry measuring at 22.5 x 6 inches.
